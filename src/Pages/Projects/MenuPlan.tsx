    After completing the{" "}
    <TextLink link="https://fullstackopen.com/">
     University of Helsinki's incredible full stack MOOC
    </TextLink>
    , I was eager to build a project using the MERN stack.
    {"\n\n"}
    In Menu Plan users are able to create, delete, like, or unlike food items
    then add them to a printable 7-day calendar. Food items are able to be
    filtered or searched.
    {"\n\n"}
    This was my first project building an entire backend and database. Although
    I was using several technologies for the first time (for example, Express,
    MongoDB, and Mongoose), I was able to find a number of excellent resources
    to complement these projects' documentation.

    I tested the backend using Jest, Supertest, and for API testing I opted to
    use VS Codeâ€™s REST API Client instead of Postman due to the relatively small
    size of the project.
    {"\n\n"}
    The client was built with React and TypeScript, React-Router for page
    routing, and Redux for global state management. For SASS/CSS I used BEM
    naming conventions, and handling the async state management I used Redux
    Thunk.
    {"\n\n"}
    Redux with Redux Thunk is very lightweight but when handling fetching logic
    with static type checking the code got hairy quickly. The solution I came up
    with at the time was refactoring Redux using the{" "}

     Redux ducks design pattern.
    </TextLink>{" "}
    and creating a custom service function.
    {"\n\n"}
    If I were to change something about this project today I would instead opt
    to use a premade service library and use a fetch management library like{" "}
